# robertFastLoot
Very lightweight addon for nearly instant looting. It also bypasses a Blizzard bug where auto loot is sometimes disabled when looting a mob too soon after it dies.

The "Loot Key" behavior is maintained, so you can still hold down whichever modifier you've configured in the game settings to temporarily disable auto looting (default is Shift).
